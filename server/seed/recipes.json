      "ingredients": "3 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder\n1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n1/4 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/4 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/4 teaspoon ancho chili powder\n3 russet potatoes, peeled\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 teaspoons worcestershire sauce\n2 tablespoons grill seasoning or dry barbecue rub (these often include salt)\n1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese\n1/4 cup chopped scallions",
      "preparation": "We’re back in the mix, aren’t we.\n\nBack from vacation.  Back to school.  Back rifling through the closet for our cowl neck sweaters.  Back contemplating hot tea and where the pumpkin comes from in pumpkin lattes.\n\nI love Fall.  I’m totally in to win.  Most Fall nights I just want to appreciate the comforts of a big grey sweater and two fingers of fine bourbon (who says that!?… I do).  The only trouble is that I go into Fall kicking and screaming…. like the jerky-est five-year old you’ve ever met… that’s me.  The fact is, I’m being crispy for no reason.  Crispy in attitude… and no one likes that.\n\nI thought I’d transfer my crisp demeanor to the oven.  It’s time for fries, like major."
